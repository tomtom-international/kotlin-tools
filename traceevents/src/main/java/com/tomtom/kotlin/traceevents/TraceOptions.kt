/**
 * This annotation can be used to annotate functions in for a trace event listener.
 * Both interfaces and individual functions can be annotated. Annotations at the function level
 * override those at the interface level.
 *
 * @param includeExceptionStackTrace Specifies whether a stack trace should be included if the last
 * parameter of the event is derived from [Throwable]. If false, only the exception message is
 * shown.
 * Default value is true.
 *
 * @param includeTaggingClass Specifies whether owner class of the event definition should be logged
 * or not.
 * Default is false.

 * @param includeFileLocation Specifies whether the filename and line number of the caller
 * should be logged or not.
 * Default is false.
 *
 * @param includeEventInterface Specifies whether the interface name of the [TraceEventListener]
 * interface should be logged or not.
 * Default is false.
